# solid-principles
exercises to understand better the SOLID principles in software design

# HOWTO
To learn from this project and the S.O.L.I.D principles of software design, read each principle package's README file. 
Then look at the problem package for the exercises.
Create your own package for the solution and compare yours with my solution. 

Here's the CHALLENGE: Make a more elegant solution! :)
